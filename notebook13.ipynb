    "\n",
    "At this point of the year we know a lot of data structures. We know about `intigers`, `lists`, `touples`, `dictionaries`, `strings`, `sets`, and a few other less emphasized ones as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also worked with `functions` and `classes`, and used quite a few Python imports. So what's next? Well there are, of course, many possible next steps, but the most logical is to talk about abstract data structures. It doesn't sound all that glamorous, but what it can accomplish...well we haven't seen the end of that yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an abstract data structure? In short an Abstract Data Structure is the implementation of an abstract data type. If this sounds familiar it should: think about the relationship between an object and a class--the building and the blueprint. But let's get a nice solid definition on the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations.\"([source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/))\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build these, we are going to rely on our knowledge of classes. In fact our class will be the abstract data structure, and what's really awesome is we can build them however we want. You've actually encountered these in a lot of areas without even realizing it. For example, using the Beautiful Soup package is an abstract data type, which even has a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are a very common metaphor in this area. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is not specifically associated with Abstract Data Structures, but it is very useful in this context. One way of thinking/computation is iterative. This is in many ways what we might consider normal thinking. The idea is that we first do one thing, then we do another thing, and so on and so forth. Recursion, however, is like a big circle back upon itself. The idea is that many complex problems can be solved by first breaking the problem down and solving a slightly simpler problem. We recursively break the problem down until we reach the simplest possible problem. We then solve that simple problem and pass the results back to the previously most complicated problem, until we have at last reached the original problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "If that doesn't make any sense, that's not all that surprising. It's very...abstract...I find the easiest way to understand it is by playing this game:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tower](tower.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is called Tower of Hanoi, and the goal is to get all of the disks from the first post to the third post. The catch is that a bigger disk can never sit on top of a smaller disk. We'll play around a little bit with this. What's truly amazing about this puzzle/game is that you can have any amount of disks!  "

    "### Question 1: Stacks and Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build a stack. To do any of these abstract data structures we're going to use classes. In Python stacks are actually incredibly easy to do. They will look kind of like a list. That is because it takes advantage of Python's ability to have lists that are flexible in size. We won't go into the underlying architecture, but what we need is to be able to have a stack, that we can add to, and then remove from. When we remove from a stack, we want to remove from the top (or most recent) data, (last in first out). What this means in practicality is that we're simply building a class around a **list**. We are essentially encoding a fancy list and calling it a stack. The key thing is that the class has two methods, push and pop. \n",
    "\n",
